<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a video game researcher who seeks a way to develop my own video game for inclusive education</p>

<p>I started my career as a lecturer in Universitas Ahmad Dahlan. At first, I started my research on
  Discourse Analysis in my undergraduate level. At that time, Barack Obama was the most fenomenal
  figure in American History as the first African American President so I took his inaugural speech
  as my source of data. For my master degree, I took cognitive linguistics as my thesis research.
  my interest at that time was based on the current trends on linguistics theories on post-structuralism.
  For my dissertation, I took my old route on discourse analysis as my research in undegraduate level.
  Yet, in my dissertation, I focused on discourse historical approach with multimodal point of view.

<p>My works on video game research can be found in my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LhyAkx8AAAAJ&hl=en"> google scholar's account</a>
Now I continued my research journey on how to make an educational video game for inclusive education purposes. 
Though my research on multimodal discourse analysis in serious or commercial video games does not stop here, but 
I want to find how my research on commercial video games can benefit the process of making more engaging education
video games for students to learn better.</p>
